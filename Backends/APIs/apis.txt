API => Application programming interface

GraphQL, SOAP, REST:API , gRPC


We are going to learn REST:API because this is most popular among the web developers

-> APIs request in postman

WHAT IS JSON?
JSON => JsvaScript Object Notation


//////////////////////////JsvaScript Object vs JSON\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

OBJECT
-----------
> properties are stored in key-value (value in the form of string) pair and seperated by a colon(:) and 
  each properties are seperated by a comma(,).
> Native JavaScript Data Type:
  JavaScript objects are native to the JavaScript language. They are actual JavaScript objects residing in memory.
> Quotes:
  In JavaScript objects, keys do not need to be enclosed in quotes unless they are reserved words or include special characters.
> Data Types:
  JavaScript objects can have more diverse data types, including functions and special JavaScript objects (like Date).
> Functions:
  Functions can be a part of a JavaScript object.

When to Use JavaScript Object:
   When working within a JavaScript environment, especially for more complex data structures.
   When you need to perform operations and use the features specific to JavaScript objects.
let obj = { 
    name: "kumkum",
    title: "Kumari",
    city: "Hazaribagh",
    education: [
        {
            degree: "Mtech",
            branch: "IPE"
        },
        {
            degree: "Btech",
            branch: "Mechanical"
        }
    ],
    hobby:{
        coding: "web development",
        specialization: "front-end development"
    } 
}


JSON
---------
> it is also stores properties in the form of key-value pair but both the value key and vlaue are in the form of string
  i.e. it uses double quotes("").
> Key and value are seperated by a colon(:) and each properties are separatedby a comma(,) as like in the Object
> String Format:
    JSON is a string-based data interchange format. It is essentially a text format that is completely language-independent.
    JSON data is represented as a string and is often used for data exchange between a server and a web application.
> Quotes:
    JSON keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes.
> Data Types:
    Limited data types are supported in JSON: strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null.
> Functions:
    JSON cannot represent functions. If a JavaScript object contains a function, it cannot be directly converted to JSON.

When to Use Each JSON:
    When you need to exchange data between a server and a client (e.g., AJAX requests).
    When you're working with data from different programming languages or platforms.
{
  "name": "kumkum",
  "title": "Kumari",
  "city": "Hazaribagh",
  "education": [
    {
      "degree": "Mtech",
      "branch": "IPE"
    },
    {
      "degree": "Btech",
      "branch": "Mechanical"
    }
  ],
  "hobby": {
    "coding": "web development",
    "specialization": "front-end development"
  }
}

 JS OBJECT => JSON

const jsonData = JSON.stringify(data);
                                 |-->JS Object

JSON => js Object
const data = JSON.parse(jsonData);
                          |--->json data
