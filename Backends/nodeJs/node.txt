Node is generally prefer as a js framework but this is not a framework, this is runtime environment,
that allows us to run javascript on our local computer not just limited to within the browser.


Native node modules / common JavaScript(CJS)
=> ues require keyword

ESM( ecma script modules)
=> uses import keyword
-> this basically provides a standardized way of using JavaScript to be consistent on the front end
   and the back end.
   It also improves things through tree shaking and a whole bunch of crazy things behind the scenes,
