..................NODEJS .......................
  An asynchronous event-driven javascript runtime , node.js is designed to build scalable network application.
Node is generally prefer as a js framework but this is not a framework, this is runtime environment,
that allows us to run javascript on our local computer not just limited to within the browser.
- Initially js was designed to run on browser, this means it was impossible to use javascript to write any kind of program that is not a website.
  but because of nodejs now it is possible to run js code on local computer  i.e. server side.
- Node uses V8 engine which is written in C and C++, it powers the chrome browser

Native node modules / common JavaScript(CJS)
=> uses "require" keyword

ESM( ECMAscript modules)
=> uses import keyword
-> this basically provides a standardized way of using JavaScript to be consistent on the front end
   and the back end.
   It also improves things through tree shaking and a whole bunch of crazy things behind the scenes,
