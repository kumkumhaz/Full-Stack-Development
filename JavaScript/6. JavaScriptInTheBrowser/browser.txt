 JAVASCRIPT IN THE BROWSER

Javascript was initially created to make web pages alive. 
JS can be written right in a web page's HTML to make it interactive.

The browsers has an embedded engine called the javascript engine on the javascript runtime.

Javascript's ability in the browser is very limited to protect the user's saftey.
For example a webpage on http://gogle.com can not access http://amazon.com and steal information from there.

DEVELOPER TOOLS
  Every browser has some developers tools which makes a developer's life a lot easier.
  F12 on chrome opens dev tools

                         request

  We can also write javascript commands in  the console.

THE SCRIPT tag
   The script tag is used to insert javascript into an HTML page.
   The script tag can be used to insert external or intenal scripts.
   <script>
   alert("hello")
   </script>
   // or...
   <Script src ="/js/this.onr.js"></script>

 The benefit of a separate javascript file is that the browser will document it and store it in its cache.
 Advantages of using separate script file using src attributes of script tag
    // 1 Separation of concerns
    // 2 Browser caching

 CONSOLE OBJECT METHODS
 The console object has several methods ,log being one of them. Some of them are as follows:

  assert() -> used to assert a condition
  clear() -> clears the console
  log() -> outputs a message to the console
  table() -> displays a tabular data
  warn() -> used for warning
  error() -> used for errors
  info() -> used for special information


  ALERT , PROMPT AND CONFIRM

ALERT :- used to invoke a mini window with a msg 
           alert("hello);

PROMPT :- Used to take user input as string
         inp = prompt("hi" , "no")
                              |
                              |---> Optional default value

Confirm :- Shows a message and waits  for the user to press ok or cancel. returns true for ok and false for cancel.
 The exact location and lok is determined by the browser which is a limitation.

WINDOW OBJECT BOM & DOM :-
 We have the following when javascript runs in a browser.

                    window                       
                   /   |  \
                  /    |   \
                DOM    BOM   JavaScript Core

  Window object represents browser window and provides methods to control it.
  It is a global object.

Document Object Model(DOM):-
 > javascript object of HTML page is called DOM.
  Dom represents the page content as HTML
   document.body --> Page body as JS object
   document.body.style.background = "green"; --> Change background to green

Browser Object Model(MOD) :-
 The browser object Model(BOM) represents additional objects provided by the browser(host environment) for working with everything except the document.
 The function alert/Confirm/prompt are also a part of the BOM.
    location.href = "https://amazon.com" --> redirect to another URL
